SystemMonitor
=============

Remote system monitoring application. Java Server and Client apps. The client connects to the server and the server streams it's own CPU usage to the client.

Currently can be used to remotely track the CPU usage of a computer running the server application. Will be expanded to transmit other types of information.
Uses the sigar.java library.
